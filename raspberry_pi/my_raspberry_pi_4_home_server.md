## Install Ubuntu Server

### 2024 Update

I followed [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) to install Ubuntu server 24.04 LTS via the Raspberry Pi Imager. Leverage the custom config settings on the Raspberry Pi Imager to automatically connect to your wi-fi and have your SSH key installed. I was able to SSH into the pi immediately after booting it up the first time without ever connecting to a monitor.

### 2020 Original

I installed Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (64-bit) from [here](https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi) using [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-your-raspberry-pi#1-overview). I did this entirely headlessly, without ever connecting the Pi to a monitor or keyboard. I plugged it directly into the router via ethernet, so there was no need to mess with wi-fi.

## SSH

### 2024 Update

I found the Pi on my UniFi Dream Router under Network >> Client Devices and logged in via `ssh calaway@192.168.1.9`. The router also automatically applied the host name, so I was able to log in without looking up the local IP via `ssh calaway@rphs`.

### 2020 Original

I used SSH to connect to the Pi remotely. Note that the router configuration in these instructions was done on my CenturyLink Zyxel C3000Z, but with any luck the same steps can be translated to other routers.

1. Log into the router at http://192.168.0.1. Navigate to `Modem Status >> Device Table`. Find the Pi's MAC address that began with `DC:A6:32` (for a Raspberry Pi 4).
    - Alternatively, you can find the IP address by following the `nmap` instructions [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ip-address.md):
    - `brew install nmap`
    - `sudo nmap -sn 192.168.0.0/24`
1. To assign a static IP address within the local network, navigate to `Advanced Setup >> DHCP Reservation`, under `4. Select MAC Address` select the MAC address or past it in manually, then select the desired IP address and click `Apply`. I assigned it to `192.168.0.3`.
1. To give the Pi a human readable name on the local network, navigate to `Advanced Setup >> DNS Host Mapping`. I set this up with:
    - DNS Host Name: `rphs` (**R**aspberry **P**i **H**ome **S**erver)
    - IP Address: `192.168.0.3`
    - Support Domain Name: `Disable` (not sure what this does, so I left it on the default)
1. To SSH into the Pi, run `ssh ubuntu@rphs`.

### RSA Authentication

To require asymetric key authentication, I followed a combination of instructions from [my PluralSight notes](./pluralsight_home_server_course_notes.md#remote-duplicati) and this [PiMyLifeUp article](https://pimylifeup.com/raspberry-pi-ssh-keys/).

To generate a key pair, I recommend following the [instructions on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).

Copy the public key from my MacBook.
```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

Save the public key on the Pi.
```bash
# Backup the original
cp -v ~/.ssh/authorized_keys{,.original}
# Edit the config, paste in the key at the end of the file, and save
vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Exit your `ssh` session and start a new one. Verify you can connect without a password. **Do not proceed if this does not work, or you will lock yourself out of the Pi.** (You would at least be able to log in via by connecting a monitor and keyboard to the Pi directly.)

Disable password logins.
```bash
# Make a copy of the sshd config
sudo cp -v /etc/ssh/sshd_config{,.original}
# Edit the config
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# Restart the SSH daemon to pick up the config change
sudo service sshd restart
```

Uncomment and edit the PasswordAuthentication line to be
```
PasswordAuthentication no
```

## Upgrades

### Manually Upgrade All Packages
To upgrade all packages, run the following.
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade --yes
```

The `update` will fetch the most recent version lists. Then `upgrade` will actually install them. The `--yes` flag will automatically accept the annoying prompt that asks you to confirm after the amount of space is calculated.

Note that `apt` is a newer, more user friendly alternative to `apt-get`.

### Automatically Upgrade All Packages
Follow [these instructions](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates#Using_the_.22unattended-upgrades.22_package) to enable automatic upgrades.
```bash
# Install the thing
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades

# Enable the thing
sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low unattended-upgrades

# Backup the original config
sudo cp /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades{,.original}

# Edit the config
sudo vim /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/20auto-upgrades
```

Add the following line to automatically reboot when necessary:
```
Unattended-Upgrade::Automatic-Reboot "true";
```

### Upgrade Ubuntu Release

Documentation from Ubuntu can be found [here](https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/how-to-upgrade-your-release).

Pre-upgrade checklist:

1. Upgrade all packages (see above)
1. Verify that you have at least a few gigabytes of free disk space via `df -h`
1. Backup all data (see below)
1. Open backup port: `iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 1022 -j ACCEPT`

```bash
# Do the thing
sudo do-release-upgrade
```

## External Hard Drive

I followed [these instructions](./pluralsight_home_server_course_notes.md#adding-external-storage) to add automatically mount my HDD via the file system table (fstab) config.

You can skip the instructions for formatting the HDD, and instead opt to do it via the GParted GUI on an Ubuntu live USB ([this guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab) from Ubuntu was also useful), or use the following instructions to partition via CLI.

### Partition the Device

```bash
# List block devices to find the location of the disk (e.g. sda1)
lsblk

# Open Parted
$ sudo parted

# Show all drives & partitions
(parted) print all

# Select the drive you want to partition
(parted) select /dev/sda

# Show just the selected drive
(parted) print

# Make a new partition table (guid partition table)
(parted) mklabel gpt

# Verify the new partition table exitsts
(parted) print

# Make a new partition comprising the full disk
(parted) mkpart calaway_1tb ext4 0gb 100%

# Verify everything looks correct
(parted) print

# Quit parted
(parted) q
```

### Format the Partition

```bash
# Find the correct partition
lsblk

# Format the partition as ext4
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1
```

### Mount the Partition

```bash
# create a mount point
cd /mnt
sudo mkdir calaway_1tb

# Create a placeholder file to help see whether the mount point worked
# If you can see this file with `ls` then it is not mounted
sudo touch calaway_1tb/placeholder

# Find the UUID of the partition you wish to mount
sudo blkid | grep UUID
# Found `/dev/sda1: LABEL="calaway_1tb" UUID="ed6c1686-5997-424d-9a0e-fa6929a53431" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="572b7278-ab40-41df-b7a3-f2e0ea77e1a6"`

# Backup fstab
sudo cp /etc/fstab{,.original}

# Edit fstab
sudo vim /etc/fstab
```

I added the following line to the bottom of the fstab file.
```
UUID=ed6c1686-5997-424d-9a0e-fa6929a53431 /mnt/calaway_1tb ext4 defaults 0 0
```

```bash
# Reboot
sudo reboot
# Verify the partition loaded automatically by making sure the placholder file is not shown
ls /mnt/calaway_1tb
# Since my drive was newly formatted, for me this only listed `lost+found`
```

## Networking

### Create a VLAN

I created a VLAN for public facing servers on my home network via my UniFi router.
1. Create the VLAN
    1. On the UniFi dashboard, navigate to Network >> Settings >> Networks >> New Virtual Network
    1. Name the new VLAN `Public Servers`
    1. Leave all other settings on defaults
1. Create a WiFi network
    1. Navigate to Network >> Settings >> WiFi >> Create New
    1. Name it `Iridium Public Servers` and assign a password
    1. Select the `Public Servers` network
    1. Under Advanced >> Manual, check Hide WiFi Name
    1. Leave all other settings on defaults

### Connect to the New WiFi Network

Network configuration on Ubuntu is handled through Netplan (see docs [here](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/server/explanation/networking/about-netplan/)).

```bash
# Check your current local IP and find the network interfaces
ip addr
# => 2: eth0: ...
# => inet 192.168.1.x/24 ...
# => 3: wlan0: ...

# Create a new config with a higher number to take precedence over the original 50-cloud-init.yaml
sudo touch /etc/netplan/51-my-config.yaml
sudo chmod g-r,o-r /etc/netplan/51-my-config.yaml
sudo vim /etc/netplan/51-my-config.yaml
```

```yaml
# /etc/netplan/51-my-config.yaml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd # networkd is the default renderer for Ubuntu server
  ethernets:
    eth0: # Ethernet network interface name from `ip addr` output above
      optional: true # Will not wait on startup if connection is not found
      dhcp4: true
  wifis:
    wlan0: # Wireless network interface name from `ip addr` output above
      optional: true
      dhcp4: true
      access-points:
        "Iridium Public Servers":
          hidden: true # Only needed if the network is hidden
          password: <wifi_password>
```

```bash
# Check the plan
sudo netplan get
# Try applying the config for 120 seconds
sudo netplan try
# Apply the config
sudo netplan --debug apply

# Verify that you're now on a 192.168.2.x address
ip addr
# => inet 192.168.2.x/24 ...
```

### Port Forwarding

My setup is a CenturyLink Zyxel C3000Z modem/router with the WiFi disabled only device plugged in via ethernet being a UniFi Dream Router.

To forward the https port from the CenturyLink router to the UniFi router:
1. Reserve a fixed IP address for the UniFi router on the CenturyLink router:
    1. Log into the CenturyLink router at http://192.168.0.1, navigate to `Modem Status >> Device Table`, and copy the MAC address for the UniFi router
    1. Navigate to `Advanced Setup >> DHCP Reservation`
      1. Select MAC Address: `Manually Enter MAC`
      1. Manually Add MAC Address: `<mac_address_from_above>`
      1. IP Address: `192.168.0.2`
      1. Apply
1. Forward the https port to the UniFi router:
    1. Still on the CenturyLink router, navigate to `Advanced Setup >> Port Forwarding`
    1. Select the UniFi router from the dropdown, or manually enter IP address
    1. Select `TCP` for the protocol
    1. Enter `443` for both the starting and ending ports
    1. Select `All IP Addresses`
    1. Apply

To forward the https port from the UniFi router to the Pi:
1. Reserve a fixed IP address for the Pi on the UniFi router:
    1. Log into the UniFi router at https://192.168.1.1 and navigate to Network >> Client Devices
    1. Find and click into the Pi device, go to settings and set Fixed IP Address to `192.168.2.6` (or whatever you want)
1. Forward the https port to the Pi:
    1. Navigate to Network >> Settings >> Security >> Port Forwarding
    1. Name: `rphs`
    1. Forward Rule: yes
    1. From: `Any`
    1. Port: `443`
    1. Forward IP: fill in local IP assigned to the Pi
    1. Forward Port: `443`
    1. Protocol: `TCP`
    1. Logging: yes

## Dynamic DNS

### Cloudflare (2024 Update)

When Google Domains died I moved to Cloudflare. To update my ddclient accordingly I used `ddclient --help` along with [these instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfHosting/comments/16wnu3s/ddclient_and_cloudflare_dynamic_dns/).

```bash
# Install ddclient and go through the setup wizard
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ddclient -y
# Validate you have version 3.10 or higher, which is required for Cloudflare tokens
ddclient --help | grep 'ddclient version'
```

In the setup wizard:
1. Provider: other, then `cloudflare`
1. Username: `token` (literally just token)
1. Password: Cloudflare API Token
1. Select Web-based IP discovery service
1. Enter your hostname: `pi.my-site.com`

```bash
# Make a copy of the original ddclient config file
sudo cp -v /etc/ddclient.conf{,.original}
# Edit the ddclient config
sudo vim /etc/ddclient.conf
```

I modified my `/etc/ddclient.conf` file to:
```conf
# /etc/ddclient.conf

# General config
# Operate as a daemon, checking every 5 minutes
daemon=5m
# Do updates over encrypted SSL connection
ssl=yes

# Router
# Obtain IP from an IP discovery page on the web
use=web, web=ipify-ipv4

# Protocol
# Use the Cloudflare protocol
protocol=cloudflare
# The domain name
zone=calaway.cc
# API token
login=token
password='my_cloudflare_api_token'
# Fully qualified domain name
pi.calaway.cc
```

Troubleshooting ddclient:
```bash
# Run this after each change to run ddclient once in non-daemon mode
sudo ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet
# See ddclient daemon status and log tail
sudo systemctl status ddclient
# Get ddclient logs
sudo journalctl -u ddclient --since "1 hour ago"
# Curl your domain
curl http://pi.calaway.cc -v
```

### Google Domains (2020 Original)

I followed [this tutorial](https://engineerworkshop.com/blog/connecting-your-raspberry-pi-web-server-to-the-internet/) to set up DDNS.

```bash
# Install ddclient and go through the setup wizard
sudo apt install ddclient
# Make a copy of the original ddclient config file
sudo cp -v /etc/ddclient.conf{,.original}
# Edit the ddclient config
sudo vim /etc/ddclient.conf
```

```conf
# /etc/ddclient.conf

daemon=300
protocol=dyndns2
use=web
server=domains.google.com
ssl=yes
login=<username without quotes>
password='<password - KEEP SINGLE QUOTES>'
pi.my-site.com
```

```bash
# Make a copy and then edit the ddclient defaults
sudo cp -v /etc/default/ddclient{,.original}
sudo vim /etc/default/ddclient
```

```
# /etc/default/ddclient
# Comment out all lines except for these two:
run_daemon="true"
daemon_interval="300"
```

```bash
# Make sure that the ddclient service is running
sudo systemctl start ddclient
# Test our ddclient configuration with the following command:
sudo ddclient -daemon=0 -debug -verbose -noquiet
```

You should receive the following message:

```
SUCCESS:  engineerworkshop.com: skipped: IP address was already set
Going back to Google Domains and looking at your Dynamic DNS record should also show your public IP address.
```

## Nextcloud

I opted to install [Nextcloud via snap](https://snapcraft.io/install/nextcloud/ubuntu), and found [this article from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-nextcloud-on-ubuntu-20-04) to be quite useful.

### Install

```bash
# Install via snap
sudo snap install nextcloud

# Optionally manually set the login credentials
sudo nextcloud.manual-install <username> <password>
```


### Set Trusted Domains

```bash
# View all current trusted domains
sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:get trusted_domains
# Set a second trusted domain in index 1
sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 1 --value=rphs
# Set a third trusted domain in index 2
sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:set trusted_domains 2 --value=pi.my-site.com
# Verify the updated list of trusted domains
sudo nextcloud.occ config:system:get trusted_domains
```

### External Hard Drive

Follow the [wiki article](https://github.com/nextcloud/nextcloud-snap/wiki/Change-data-directory-to-use-another-disk-partition) to change data directory to use another disk partition. This [Stack answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/882696) was also helpful.

```bash
# Give the snap permission to access removable media by connecting that interface
sudo snap connect nextcloud:removable-media

# Verify the connection was added
snap connections nextcloud

# Create the directory and set owner & permissions
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/calaway_1tb/nextcloud/data
sudo chown -R root:root /mnt/calaway_1tb/nextcloud/data

# Stop the snap from running for a moment
sudo snap stop nextcloud

# Make a copy and then edit the Nextcloud config
sudo cp -v /var/snap/nextcloud/current/nextcloud/config/config.php{,.original}
sudo vim /var/snap/nextcloud/current/nextcloud/config/config.php
```

```config
# Change
'datadirectory' => '/var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data'
# to the desired directory
'datadirectory' => '/mnt/calaway_1tb/nextcloud/data'
```

```bash
# Copy the current data directory to the new place
sudo cp -rv /var/snap/nextcloud/common/nextcloud/data /mnt/calaway_1tb/nextcloud

# Re-enable the snap:
sudo snap start nextcloud
```

### TLS Certificates via Let's Encrypt

See instructions [here](https://github.com/nextcloud-snap/nextcloud-snap/wiki/configure-Nextcloud-snap#https-encryption-with-lets-encrypt).

```bash
# Run this script and follow the prompts
sudo nextcloud.enable-https lets-encrypt
```
Note to self: I used email address `e********@gmail.com` in 2020 and `c********@gmail.com` in 2024.

## Backup and Restore SD Card
### Backup

I followed a mix of these instructions from [my PluralSight notes](./pluralsight_home_server_course_notes.md#backing-up) and [this article](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/full-metal-backup-using-dd-command/).

Power down the Pi.
```bash
sudo shutdown -h now
```

Remove the SD card and insert it into the machine you're backing it up to.
```bash
# Find the correct device
diskutil list
# Make a bit-for-bit copy and compress it
sudo dd if=/dev/diskx bs=1m conv=noerror,sync status=progress | gzip -c  > ~/Documents/backups/pi_2020-07-31.img.gz
```

### Restore

```bash
# Become root
sudo su
# Find the right disk
diskutil list
# Unmount the disk
sudo diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2
# Copy the backup to the disk
gunzip -c /Users/calaway/Backups/rphs-2024-08-17.img.gz | sudo dd of=/dev/disk2 bs=4M status=progress
```

## Tooling

### Oh My Zsh

Follow instructions from the [Oh My Zsh readme](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).

```bash
# Check to see if zsh is already installed
zsh --version
# If not, install it
sudo apt install zsh --yes
# Download and run the Oh My Zsh install script
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

Copy over anything from `~/.bashrc` that you want. Note that `shopt` isn't available in Zsh, so don't copy any of that. Anything with the prompt didn't work for me either.

Customizations:
* Theme: `ZSH_THEME="avit"`
